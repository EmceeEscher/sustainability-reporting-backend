-better error handling for deleting tables
-better error handling for creating types
-CWL!!!!
-write docs for endpoints...
-write docs for schema...
-handle error for "Insertion error" (in addStarsCredit)
-handle error for "missing paired action" (in getStarsCredits)
-handle case where action is inserted successfully, but stars credit isn't

NEXT TIME:
-try and cause errors with metric endpoints

Productionization:
-hide create/delete tables/types endpoints
