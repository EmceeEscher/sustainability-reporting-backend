-better error handling for deleting tables (incomplete)
-better error handling for creating types (incomplete)
-CWL!!!! (blocked by IT)

10/23:

-rename 'stakeholder_id' in actions table to 'assignee_id' (incomplete)
-create scripts to populate tables with test data (incomplete)

11/28:

-Fix star bug: after initial load, or after change made in important action panel (not all action panel),
star does not properly fill in. Switching tabs fixes it. Clicking it also fixes it (with apparently no ill effects
beyond error message in console)
-Fix tab bug: when removing all important actions from a tab, the tab doesn't go away

-add way to edit metrics


Productionization:
-hide create/delete tables/types endpoints
